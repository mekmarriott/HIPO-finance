This application was developed for the Capital 1 Hackathon in San Francisco. Our team focused on solving personal finance challenges for the next generation. Our solution was a videoconferencing, visualization, and Watson integrated platform to drive meaningful and insightful discussion and realizations about saving and spending habits.
